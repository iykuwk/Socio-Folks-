        <h1>Our Mission & Vision</h1>
        <p><span class="highlight">Mission:</span> To brighten the lives of orphaned children by not just providing food, but empowering them with technical knowledge, educational resources, and heartfelt support that nurtures their dreams and future.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Vision:</span> We envision a world where every child, regardless of their circumstances, is embraced with love, equipped with tools for success, and inspired to create a future filled with hope, innovation, and happiness.</p>

      <h1>Experience with ACT Foundation</h1>
      <p>This project gave us a chance to make a meaningful impact, but it also came with its challenges. Coordinating with the orphanage and planning an activity suitable for 8–10 year-olds was not easy. Selecting a simple yet educational project took time and careful thought. Managing purchases and creating child-friendly handouts tested our planning and creativity skills.</p>
      <p>But all the effort was rewarded when we saw the children’s excited faces. Their happiness, curiosity, and involvement in the activity made us forget the stress. The teachers appreciated our work, especially as it was the first study-based activity for the kids. It was a learning experience for us too — one that taught us teamwork, patience, and the power of education.</p>
